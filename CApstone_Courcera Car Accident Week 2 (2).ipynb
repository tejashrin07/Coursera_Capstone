We downsampled to match the minority class exactly with 58188 values each.\n\nOnce we analyzed and cleaned the data, it was then fed through three ML models; K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. Although the first two are ideal for this project, logistic regression made most sense because of its binary nature.\n\nEvaluation metrics used to test the accuracy of our models were jaccard index, f-1 score and logloss for logistic regression. Choosing different k, max depth and hyparameter C values helped to improve our accuracy to be the best possible."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Conclusion"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Based on historical data from weather conditions pointing to certain classes, we can conclude that particular weather conditions have a somewhat impact on whether or not travel could result injury"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
